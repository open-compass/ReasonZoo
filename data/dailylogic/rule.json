Each puzzle consists of a number of elements (e.g., houses, people, cars) and their corresponding attributes (e.g., names, nationalities, drinks).\n2. Each element is uniquely associated with one value for each attribute, and no two elements share the same value for a given attribute.\n3. The puzzle is defined by a set of clues, which provide true and non-contradictory information about the relationships between elements and their attributes.\n4. The information provided by the clues needs to be combined and analyzed to deduce the complete arrangement of elements and their attributes.\n5. All deductions must follow logically from the given clues without assuming information not explicitly provided.","tag": "riddle"},
