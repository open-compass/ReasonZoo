    "question": "An investment bank has a total budget of 14 million euros, and can make 4 types of investments (numbered 1, 2, 3, 4).

Suggest a way, beside the simplex algorithm, to solve the continuous relaxation of the problem, and use it within a Branch-and-Bound algorithm to solve the problem. Please only answer the maximum revenue, in the format of [[24]] if the maximum revenue is 24.",
    "answer": "[[42]]",
    "needle": "The formulation of the problem is as follows:max 16x1 + 22x2 + 12x3 + 8x4 5x1 + 7x2 + 4x3 + 3x4 \u2264 14 x1, x2, x3, x4 \u2208 {0, 1}. In order to solve the continuous relaxation of this integer programming problem, we order the ratios between revenue and cost of each investment: (16/5, 22/7, 12/4, 8/3) = (3.2, 3.14, 3, 2.66). It follows that 1,2,3,4 is the preference order given by revenue per unit investment cost. We now take fractions of the various investments in the given preference order (recall we are solving the continuous relaxation now, so fractions are allowed) so that (a) the fractions grow to be at most 1 and (b) the knapsack constraint 5x1 + 7x2 + 4x3 + 3x4 \u2264 14 is satisfied. For exoperation search programe, at node 1 we have x1 = 1 (total invested amount: 5 million euros), x2 = 1 (total invested amount: 5+7=12 million euros), x3 = 12(total invested amount: 12+2=14 million euros). We can use this solution method within a Branch and Boundalgorithm. The latter adds constraints of the type xi \u2264 0 or xi \u2265 1 at each relaxed subproblem, which must be easily taken into account by forcing either the zero or the total investment of particular type.",

The objective function to minimize is the sum of the distances between locations, expressed as: \nMinimize: sum(i, j) distance_ij * x_ij. \nThe constraints are: \n- Each location must be visited exactly once: sum(j) x_ij = 1 for all i, sum(i) x_ij = 1 for all j. \n- The triangular inequality is enforced: x_ij + x_jk >= x_ik for all i, j, k. \nTo solve this problem using your math model, we would define the distance matrix and the binary decision variables, write the objective function and constraints, and use a suitable solver. For the heuristic method, the nearest neighbor algorithm can be employed, where the salesman starts at location 1 and iteratively chooses the nearest unvisited location until all locations are visited.",

Solve the problem with your math model with the following data: m = 2140kg, H = 23km, T = 1min, b = 10000N, n = 20. Hint: The problem can be formulated as a linear program by discretizing the time into n intervals, defining the force acting on the rocket at each time step, and minimizing the total energy consumed by the rocket during its ascent. The energy consumption is proportional to the force applied over the time intervals. Let y(tk) denote the altitude at time tk and u(tk) the applied force at time tk.

    "question": "The Operations Department of the FORDASA automobile manufacturing and assembly firm must establish the daily production quantities of two families of cars (four-door saloon and people carrier) which maximise profits according to the production capacity constraints. The firm also wishes to respect the environment, and in the future to benefit its sales, given its commitment to increase the FFM (fleet fuel mileage) indicator; that is, the mileage efficiency per litre of fuel of produced fleet. To simplify this study case, a linear relation between the sale price and the quantity to be produced is assumed, given by the following function: q_i = a_i - b_i * p_i, where a_i and b_i are constants, and are provided in Table 3.2, and p_i is the mean unit price per family of cars in thousands of dollars. The data in Table 3.2 is as follows:\n\n| i | Family of Cars       | a   | b   | C (thousands of dollars) | R (s) | Kmpl |\n|---|----------------------|-----|-----|--------------------------|-------|------|\n| 1 | 4-door saloons       | 440 | 20  | 17                       | 54    | 12   |\n| 2 | People carriers      | 248 | 12  | 13                       | 56    | 20   |\n\nThe FFM indicator, which must at least be below 15 Kmpl, is calculated by the harmonic mean: FFM = (q_1 + q_2) / (q_1 / kmpl_1 + q_2 / kmpl_2). The only productive resource that restricts the system is the assembly line. It is estimated that the firm spends 1 hour every day on assembling four-door saloons and people carriers. The time required (R_i) to produce one unit of each family of cars is as follows: R_1 = 54 seconds for four-door saloons and R_2 = 56 seconds for people carriers. The firm aims to optimise production while meeting the constraints, including the FFM requirement and time limitations.Answer in the format of [[max_profit]]",

SUN2 has committed its production capacity to other orders, and the only alternative left to serve the new order is to subcontract the production involved. SUN2 has located two possible suppliers: Supplier A, based in Romania, which would sell SUN2 each panel for 500$; Supplier B, from Poland, which would sell each panel for 550$. The cost to transport one batch of 40 panels from either of the two suppliers to the German firm is 1,000$. Nonetheless, the customer\u2019s technical specifications are very demanding, so SUN2 estimates that Supplier A could supply one correct batch with a probability of 70 %, whereas Supplier B could do it with a probability of 80 %. If the batch were incorrect, SUN2 could sell it to another customer at the price of 200$ per panel.\n\nSUN2 is considering the possibility of asking for a test panel from each supplier to test it before placing an order. SUN2\u2019s testing system guarantees that a faulty panel is always detected, while there is a 5 % margin of error with correct panels.

Currently, the percentage of faulty articles that the machine produces appears to be constant, where p = 0.10 or p = 0.25. Faulty articles are produced randomly and there is no way that ADESA can certainly state if the machine needs minor or major repairs. If minor repairs are done when p = 0.25, the probability of obtaining faulty articles lowers to 0.05. If minor repairs are done when p = 0.10, or if major repairs are done when p = 0.10 or p = 0.25, the proportion of faulty parts comes down to 0. The a priori probability that the percentage of faulty parts in the machine is p = 0.10 is 0.70.\n\nADESA has just received an order of 1,000 articles.

    "question": "Jake Farlow, the Chair of Playaview Building, is thinking about presenting a bid to acquire property which will be sold in a sealed bid as part of a foreclosure to pay taxes in Alicante. Initially, the idea is to present an offer of 5 million $, with a probability of 0.2 of being the highest, for the purpose of obtaining the property for Playaview. Today the date is 1 June. The offers to acquire property must be presented before 15 August. The winning bid will be published on 1 September. If Playaview presents the highest bid and obtains the property, the firm can study constructing and selling a luxury apartments complex. However, a factor that complicates the issue is that the property is currently in an area used only for detached houses. Jake believes that a referendum can be organised in time for the November elections. If the referendum is passed, the property area will be changed and it will be possible to build apartment blocks.\n\nTable 7.1 Estimations of costs and income\n\n| Income from selling apartments | $15,000,000 |\n| Land                          | $5,000,000  |\n| Building                       | $8,000,000  |\n\nTable 7.2 Probabilities of obtaining accurate information\n\n| Changes in area approved | Changes in area not approved |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Approved changes in area predicted | 0.9 | 0.2 |\n| Approved changes in area not predicted | 0.1 | 0.8 |\n\nThe sealed bid procedure entails Jake having to send a certified cheque covering 10 % of the amount offered. If the offer is rejected, the deposit paid will be returned. If the offer is accepted, the deposit will become the initial payment for the property. However, if the offer is accepted, and the bidder does not continue with the purchase, and does not meet the remaining financial obligations within the next 6 months, the deposit will be lost. In this case, the province of Alicante will offer the property to the next highest bid. In order to determine if Playaview must present the offer of 5 million $, Jake carried out a preliminary analysis which gave him an estimation of 0.3 for the probability of passing the referendum to change the area, which gave the estimations of the costs and income indicated in Table 7.1, which would be incurred if the apartments were built.\n\nIf Playaview acquires the property and the changes in the area are not approved in November, Jake thinks that the best option would be that the firm does not purchase the property.\n\nJake has suggested that the firm contracts a market research service to conduct a survey among voters, which should provide a better estimation of the possibility of deciding on the changes in the area by referendum. The market research firm is happy to conduct the study, which will be available by 1 August, at a price of 15,000$. Table 7.2 shows the estimations of probability related with the accuracy or preciseness of the market research information:\n\n(a) Draw a decision tree showing the logical sequence of the decision problem.\n(b) Indicate the decision strategy that Playaview should adopt if no market research study is done.\n(c) Justify if Playaview must resort to a market research firm or not.

    "question": "The Director of Logistics of a textile firm is in charge of deciding between buying a new electric forklift truck costing $25,000 or a second-hand 10-year-old costing $12,500, to handle textile parts weighing up to 2,100 kg and for a height of up to 4 m. The maintenance costs of a new forklift truck for the next 10 years are estimated at $1,000, whereas the costs of maintaining a second-hand truck are expected to double those of a new one.\n\nEvidently if the second-hand forklift truck operates properly, it entails a saving of $11,500, but if it is faulty, it will entail losing the money spent on not only purchasing it, but also on the purchase and maintenance of a new model. Evidently, the Director will be reprimanded by the Manager. Based on the statistical data provided by the seller, the Director of Logistics has established that the proportion of faulty second-hand equipment is 20 % and that the reliability of a new forklift truck is considered 100 %.\n\nBefore purchasing a second-hand forklift truck, two types of mechanical and electric tests can be done:\n\n\u2022 TEST A: at a cost of $1,000, whose diagnosis offers a percentage of failures of 5 % if it is faulty, and of 20 % if it operates properly.\n\n\u2022 TEST B: consists in two successive phases. In the first one, whose cost is $800, a preliminary diagnosis can be made whose probability of error is 15 %. The second phase entails deciding whether to buy or reject the forklift truck, or to complete the test, which costs a further $700, in order to be absolutely sure about the state the equipment is in.\n\n(a) Draw the corresponding decision tree and indicate with a letter per branch the associated probability or the associated cost (depending on the case).\n(b) Solve the decision tree and obtain the most economic decision.\n(c) What is the The perfect information value?

    "question": "A film producer is considering filming a picture about the life of a singer who died recently. It is predicted that if the film is not successful, 15 million $ will be lost, but 45 million $ will be earned if it were a success.\n\nThe producer has estimated the probability of the film being a success based on these aspects:\n\n\u2022 The film script can centre only on the singer\u2019s professional life or can include details about the singer\u2019s private life. Irrespective of the script, there is a 10 % probability that the film will be successful.\n\n\u2022 If the film director is to be well-known Petro Dovar, who will only accept filming the film if it centres on the singer\u2019s private life, the probability of the film being a success becomes 50 %. In this case, both the predicted losses and earnings will increase or decrease in 5 million $, respectively, to cover the film\u2019s, the initially estimated profits and probabilities data will not change.\n\nBefore filming, the film producer has the option of paying a famous film critic 1 million $ to receive a view about the film\u2019s success. In the past, this famous film critic has predicted that films would be a success in 60 % of cases, and that they would flop in 90 % of cases. Evidently, the film critic\u2019s predictions will have to consider the film director\u2019s characteristics.\n\nThe film producer wishes to maximise the expected earnings.\n\n(a) Draw a decision tree to determine the best strategy.
