    "question": "Paddi was born on June 26, 3507 in the Goat Calendar. He thought it was too few to celebrate his birthday only once a year. So he decided to set a new birthday rule: from the day he was born until that day, if the number of days passed contains '26', then this day is his \"self - defined birthday\". For example, the 526th day, the 3261st day, the 10261st day, etc. are all his \"self - defined birthdays\", while the 236th day, the 623rd day, etc. are not. If calculated based on a lifespan of 30,000 days, how many \"self - defined birthdays\" can Paddi have in his life? ",

The small triangles are placed together with no gaps, forming a larger triangular grid. This grid can also be visualized as a large equilateral triangle originally made of four rows with 1, 3, 5, and 7 small triangles respectively (a total of 16 triangles), where each side of the large triangle has a length of 4 small triangle edges.
