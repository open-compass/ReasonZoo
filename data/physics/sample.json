The plates are horizontal and sufficiently long, and the lower plate is grounded. The capacitor is connected with a switch S, resistors R1 and R2 to form a circuit (as would be shown in a diagram, though the diagram itself isn't text). Terminals a and b are two output terminals. When switch S is open, the space between the plates is filled with a uniform magnetic field of magnetic induction strength B, directed perpendicularly into the plane of the paper. A beam of charged particles, each with mass m and charge q (q > 0), enters the region between the plates horizontally with velocity v0 along the edge of the lower plate. The number of particles entering per unit time is n. The gravitational force on the charged particles is negligible, they do not come into contact with the lower plate, and edge effects of the plates as well as interactions between charged particles are to be ignored. To enable the charged particles to land on the upper plate of the capacitor, find the maximum plate separation $d_m$. Under the condition of (1) (i.e., with $d = d_m$), find the maximum charge $Q_m$ that the capacitor can store.Given $R_1 = 2R$ and $R_2 = R$.

    "question": "A U-shaped conductive frame with mass M = 0.06 kg  is placed reversely on a fixed smooth inclined plane at an angle \\(\\alpha\\). The frame has negligible electrical resistance. A metallic rod \\(CD\\) with a resistance of \\(R = 3\\Omega\\) is placed on the frame's rails' upper part, i.e. the top of U character, forming a rectangular circuit \\(CDEF\\). The bottom of the U-shaped frame \\(EF\\) is parallel to the bottom of the inclined plane. The length of the metallic rod is \\(L = 0.6m\\).\n\nInitially, the metallic rod \\(CD\\) is at rest and aligned with \\(EF\\) at a distance \\(s_0 = 0.4m\\). The metallic rod and the conductive frame start moving together from rest.  The open side of U is toward the bottom of the slope, so the rod CD would lead when sliding down. After sliding down a distance \\(s_1 = \\frac{3}{16}m\\), the rod enters a strong uniform magnetic field region perpendicular to the plane.  \n\nAfter entering the magnetic field, the metallic rod undergoes uniform motion until it exits the field. The moment the rod leaves the magnetic field, the bottom edge \\(EF\\) of the conductive frame enters the field, and the conductive frame begins to accelerate after moving a short distance at a uniform velocity. The contact between the metallic rod and the frame is always good.

Simplify the cube: For the convenience of discussion, if the coordinate value \\(x_i\\) of any vertex of the cube is only 0 or 1, that is, not \\(\\pm2,\\pm3,\\cdots\\), then this cube is called a simplified cube. Unless otherwise specified, the cubes discussed below are all simplified cubes. Vertices with \\(\\sum_{i = 1}^{K}x_i=j\\) are collectively called the \\(j\\) - th group of vertices. The number of vertices in the \\(j\\) - th group of vertices is \\(C_{K}^{j}\\).

Before it hits the ground, the lower - end \\(B\\) of the thin rod never leaves the ground. At a certain moment, the inclined shape of the thin rod is as shown in Figure 2, where point \\(C\\) is the mid - point of the thin rod.\n Given that the length \\(l\\) of the thin rod and the angle \\(\\phi\\) in Figure 2 are known quantities, determine the direction and magnitude of the acceleration \\(a_M\\) of the instantaneous center \\(M\\) at this moment.\n\n#### Explanation of \"instantaneous center\"\nIn the study of the planar motion of rigid bodies, the instantaneous center is a very important concept. At a certain instant, the motion of a rigid body in a plane can be regarded as pure rotation around a specific point. This point is called the instantaneous center of velocity, abbreviated as the instantaneous center.\n\nThe velocity of the instantaneous center itself is zero at that instant. The velocity directions of other points on the rigid body are perpendicular to the lines connecting these points and the instantaneous center, and their magnitudes are proportional to the distances from these points to the instantaneous center. For example, in the motion of a rolling wheel on a flat surface without slipping, the contact point between the wheel and the ground is the instantaneous center at that moment. Understanding the concept of the instantaneous center is very helpful for analyzing the velocity and acceleration of each point on a rigid body in planar motion, simplifying the complex planar motion into a rotational motion problem around the instantaneous center.
